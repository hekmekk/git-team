# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- The `--only-alias|-o` flag to the `[assignments] ls|list` command.

### Fixed
- [Issue 18](https://github.com/hekmekk/git-team/issues/18): now printing helpful information when running into an unknown git config error.
- Output of `status`, `config`, and `[assignments] ls|list` commands now use the terminal default color instead of a hardcoded white.
- The help for the `config` command now also includes its 'display' function.

## [1.8.1]
### Fixed
- The zsh completion script now correctly provides suggestions for the command `git team` (in addition to `git-team`).

## [1.8.0] - 2022-10-28
### Added
- The `completion zsh` subcommand providing a zsh completion script.
- The bash completion script (`git-team completion bash`) now also completes flags.

## [1.7.1] - 2022-10-09
### Fixed
- An [issue](https://github.com/hekmekk/git-team/issues/7) where a previously configured `core.hooksPath` was ignored while git-team was enabled and not restored when git-team was disabled again.

## [1.7.0] - 2021-05-31
### Added
- Scripting prerequisites for the `assignments add` sub-command. It can now handle input from stdin and understand a new flag `--keep-existing|-k` which skips existing assignments instead of asking for override.

### Fixed
- A [shell incompatibility issue](https://github.com/hekmekk/git-team/pull/16) within the prepare-commit-msg hook script which resulted in broken co-author output (`echo` command flags which weren't interpreted by some shells) when using e.g. `git commit -m`.

## [1.6.0] - 2021-05-16
### Added
- New command `completion` has been introduced. The output of this command can be sourced as is to get shell completion. Bash is the only supported shell for the moment.

## [1.5.5] - 2021-05-04
### Fixed
- Adherence to linux FHS. This mostly affects where hooks are being stored. They no longer live in `/usr/local/etc/git-team/hooks` but are dynamically installed into `~/.git-team/hooks`. The previous path wasn't quite correctly chosen.
- Installation paths (e.g. prefix, bindir, man1dir) are now configurable during installation as git-team no longer relies on fixed paths, except for `~/git-team`, which is now used for commit templates and hooks. This makes it possible to resolve an issue where the hooks path had to be removed manually after removing git-team via homebrew, as it wasn't possible to rely on homebrew magic variables during installation.

## [1.5.4] - 2021-04-23
### Fixed
- Execute a local `prepare-commit-msg` git hook after the git-team hook.
- Properly fail proxied local git hooks.

## [1.5.3] - 2021-03-29
### Fixed
- Include `go.sum` file in order to hopefully resolve [an issue on osx during installation](https://github.com/hekmekk/homebrew-git-team/issues/1).

## [1.5.2] - 2020-11-10
### Fixed
- Parameters are being passed to existing git hooks.

## [1.5.1] - 2020-10-30
### Fixed
- Usage section for different commands and subcommands.

## [1.5.0] - 2020-10-30
### Added
- New flag `--all|-A` for the `enable` command to include all known co-authors.

### Changed
- Shell completion is now done within the application itself.

### Deprecated
- `enable` as a default command

## [1.4.1] - 2020-09-13
### Fixed
- Don't append co-authors to a commit message if they are part of it already. This may happen when co-authors have been added manually or when both the commit template as well as the `prepare-commit-msg` hook take effect (e.g.: IDEs reading from the commit template and writing the entire content (including co-authors) back as a single commit message).

## [1.4.0] - 2020-05-10
### Added
- New command `config` has been introduced to view and edit the configuration
- The `activation-scope` can now be configured (options: `global` (default), `repo-local`) via `git-team config`

## [1.3.8] - 2019-10-26
### Added
- Co-authors are appended for `git merge [--squash]`

## [1.3.7] - 2019-10-04
### Changed
- Minor adjustments to the `bash_comletion` script

## [1.3.6] - 2019-10-02
### Added
- New flag `-f|--force-override` for `assignments add` subcommand

## [1.3.5] - 2019-09-19
### Added
- Command `assignments` with subcommands (`add`, `rm` and `ls`)

### Deprecated
- Commands `add`, `rm` and `ls`

### Changed
- Command line output format
- Configuration is now stored within `git config`

### Fixed
- Signal error when trying to remove a non-existing assignment

## [1.3.4] - 2019-09-04
### Changed
- Proxy scripts for repo-local git hooks are now symlinked

## [1.3.3] - 2019-09-03
### Fixed
- Install proxy scripts for repo-local git hooks so that they won't be disabled when git-team is enabled

## [1.3.2] - 2019-08-30
### Fixed
- Show an empty list when there are no assignments instead of failing with an error

## [1.3.1] - 2019-08-20
### Changed
- Refactor Makefile
- Add section on homebrew as an installation option
- Install git-team to `/usr/bin`
- build packages for multiple targets (deb and rpm)

## [1.3.0] - 2019-08-11
### Added
- Support `git commit -m <msg>` via a `prepare-commit-msg` hook
- Ask the user if an existing assignment should be overridden

### Changed
- The `list` command is now an alias for `ls` and will no longer be suggested via auto-completion

## [1.2.1] - 2019-08-07
### Fixed
- Make the `disable` command work reliably. It would occasionally not have any effect at all.

## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-30
### Changed
- Always sort lists presented to the user (aliases, co-authors)
- Ignore duplicates when running `enable` command

## [1.1.3] - 2019-07-28
### Changed
- Implementation of `add` command

## [1.1.2] - 2019-07-26
### Fixed
- Persistence of current status (enabled, disabled)

## [1.1.1] - 2019-07-26
### Changed
- Adjust code structure to increase test coverage

## [1.1.0] - 2019-07-14
### Added
- `ls` as an alias for `list` command

## [1.0.1] - 2019-06-30
### Fixed
- Show an empty list when there are no assignments instead of failing with an error

## [1.0.0] - 2019-04-17
### Changed
- Make this go v1.12 compliant

## [0.3.0] - 2018-10-28
### Added
- The ability to manage co-authors by assigning aliases to them

## [0.2.0] - 2018-10-24
### Fixed
- Installation via `make install` on osx

## [0.1.0] - 2018-08-06
